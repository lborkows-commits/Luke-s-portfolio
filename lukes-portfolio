    <!-- ABOUT -->
    <section class="section" id="about">
        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I’m a musician, coder, and robotics enthusiast who loves creating things that merge 
            creativity with technology. I’ve produced and released original music, handled 
            recording and mixing, and developed a detailed ear that pushes me to refine my craft. 
            My curiosity also drives my coding work, where I’ve taught myself Python and machine 
            learning through hands-on projects. I enjoy exploring problems deeply, iterating, and 
            building better tools—whether in a studio, on a robotics field, or behind a keyboard.

        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <!-- Harmoniq -->
        <div class="project">
            <div class="project-title">Harmoniq — AI-Powered Music-Creation Studio</div>
            <p>
                Developed as a first-year innovation project at the USC Iovine & Young Academy, 
                Harmoniq is an AI-driven platform that transforms raw vocal recordings into polished, 
                release-ready tracks. It addresses the complexity and high cost of traditional 
                music-production tools while offering intuitive features such as real-time mastering 
                feedback, genre-aware processing, personalized sound profiles, A/B comparisons, 
                and transparent AI explanations.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project included market analysis, a competitive landscape study, financial projections, 
                and a freemium-based business model. I helped shape the concept, design features, and 
                articulate the product vision as part of a collaborative multidisciplinary team.
